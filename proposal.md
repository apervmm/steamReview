## 1. What question are you trying to answer?
This study explores how user engagement metrics (ex. total playtime, number of games owned, review frequency) and contextual factors (ex. whether the game was purchased or obtained for free, early access status, developer responses, language) affect helpfulness of reviews for attempting to play/purchase the game.

## 2. Why is this question worth answering?
I'm the type of person who makes a very long decision by diving into reviews and letsplays before attempting to play/purchase the game myself. Even if some stories of the game gets spoiled, I just don't want to attempt the game and dislike it several hours later. Hence, I want to analyze what review factors can/should I or anybody else consider to answer themselfs if the game is worth of playing especially for a small scale games.


## 3. Hypotheses
- **Hypothesis 1:** Reviews from users who have purchased the game (as opposed to obtained it for free) will be rated as more helpful
- **Hypothesis 2:** Reviews written during a game’s early access are more likely to be critical about the game specifications and expectations.
- **Hypothesis 3:** More recent reviews will carry greater weight in decision making compared to older reviews. Since small-scale games can evolve quickly through updates, current reviews are more likely to reflect the game’s present state. 

## 4. Dataset Details
